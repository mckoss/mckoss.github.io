This paper simulator of a German Enigma machine is 100% compatible with the
real thing; you can send and receive messages between the Paper Enigma and the
WWII-era cryptography machine.

Just print (I suggest using heavy card stock), cut out the strips, and follow the
directions on the page to build your own fully functional Enigma machine.
This machine is compatible with the original 3-rotor German Enigma used
during World War II. For simplicity it omits the *ring settings* and
plug board, but the primary workings of the machine are captured in this
model. It's great as an educational tool, or just for fun!
