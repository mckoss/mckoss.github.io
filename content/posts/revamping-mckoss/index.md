mckoss.com started it's life on the internet [since at least 1999](https://web.archive.org/web/19990125090830/http://mckoss.com:80/) looking like this:

I even had a way of sending SMS messages to my pager-watch along with my old cell phone number on the internet for all to see.  This page was all hand-crafted by me; it may not have even had any
css in it for all I can tell.  Just some `align=left`, `h1`, `<i>` tags, etc.  I think I may have used FrontPage to create it intially.

Several years ago, I got fed up with my web host, and I just let mckoss.com fade into the Wayback Machine.  It was a shame, as it was getting several thousands of reads per day - so someone was getting some out of some of the content.

I've been meaning to resurrect mckoss.com using a more modern design (or at least *some* design).  A few times I played with Jekyll as a static site generator - but I really don't like the tool chain that depends on Ruby; a language I never much cared for with some obscure (to me) package installation mechanisms.

So now, in 2021, I am trying [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a static site generator written in Go.  Go is a language I actually like, and besides, Go compiles to native binaries and so there are no 3rd party packages to have to install.  A Go program is self-contained (as desktop software *should* be).

Out of nostalgia, here are some more milestones in the history of mckoss.com:

I started blogging about stuff that kept me busy after leaving Microsoft (travel, flying, skiing).  And the Big Seattle Earthquake of 2001 was big news.

I finally updated the heading to use some images, and thumbnails for the different projects I posted about.  Definitely getting a little away from the 1999 look.

Except for adding a few more projects (and promoting my new hobby of wake-surfing to the header image), mckoss.com's final appearance looked much the same up through 2015. *Note the now-defunct flash player to embed a YouTube video for our failed social-bookmarking startup.*

Now that I have a more modern static web site generator to update this blog, I'm hopefull that I can resurrect some of the old content that may still be of interest and imported it into Hugo.
